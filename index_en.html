          <p>Mariia Rizun's research visit focused on empirical research on the operation of information systems in a German higher education institution 
		     with the aim of designing an extended knowledge management information system that supports the recruitment process of teachers at universities. 
		     The concept is to take into account the particularities of Polish and German universities so that it can be applied effectively in both countries. 
		     A large number of students, staff and teachers at THB were interviewed personally and via an online questionnaire. The results of this research 
			 and of the previous survey at two Polish universities were presented and discussed in the BMaKE seminar. 
			 In addition, Mariia Rizun took part together with Prof. Vera Meister and Wenxin Hu in an ORKG workshop at the TIB Hannover and 
			 in activities during a teaching and research visit of a Ukrain delegation from the Alfred Nobel University Dnipro. 
			 The research visit of Mariia Rizun was financed from the internationalization budget of the Vice President for Research of the THB.</p>

		     Berlin Semantic Web Meetup</a>. The topic was the use of Semantic Web technologies in the library world. 
		     The following questions were addressed: How has the use of library catalogs and metadata in general developed in recent decades? 
			 What is linked open data, how does it relate to the Semantic Web, and what problems can it solve for libraries? 
			 What data has been made available by libraries on the Web, and to what extent? 
			 How can this data be used both by libraries themselves to improve their services and by others to develop new services? 
			 Speakers were Felix Ostrowski - a web researcher and developer - and Johann Rolschewski, staff member of the Berlin State Library. 
			 Prof. Vera Meister has been attending the Semantic Web Meetup events regularly since 2014 and has already made

			 There the idea arose to cooperate within the scope of final theses or research and development projects. In March 2018 Jan Beckert - 
			 student of THB - started his compulsory internship at eccenca in Leipzig. In April 2017, he accompanied Prof. Vera Meister on an exchange 
			 visit to the Alfred Nobel University in Dnipro, where he participated in a guest lecture on knowledge engineering. 
			 This topic immediately interested him and so we were able to agree on a topic for Jan's thesis that is of great interest to both partners.

          <p>After a one-year break, the compulsory elective courses on semantic technologies will start under a new title and with a new concept. 
		     Instead of the linear teaching of the most important relevant semantic web technologies, the focus will be more on the 
			 <a href="pages/research_en.html" target="_blank">prototypes</a> as developed in the BMaKE research group. 
			 Since most of these knowledge graph-based systems address organizational structures and professional services, the courses were renamed:</p>

			 <li>EKEN - Enterprise Knowledge Engineering: 2nd semester Master Business Information Systems</li>
			 <li>EKGI - Enterprise Knowledge Graph Implementation: 3rd semester Master usiness Information Systems</li>
			</ul>
		  <p>In addition to reverse engineering in the context of the prototypes, other activating methods are used:</p>
		    <ul>
			 <li>Learning by Teaching: Students explain SPARQL to their fellow students based on Bob DuCharme's reference book.</li>
			 <li>Inverted Classroom: Lectures are consumed digitally (video) and the contents and problems are discussed and solved in class.</li>
			 <li>Projekt-based Learning: Students create their own small knowledge graph-based systems in a standardized environment.</li>
