          <p style="color:#969696">2nd October 2019</p>
          <p>The elective module "Enterprise Knowledge Graph Implementation" met with a pleasingly large interest. 14 students of the 
		     Master's programme in Business Informatics will dedicate themselves to the (further) development of knowledge graph-based 
			 prototypes. In her introductory  <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/VeraGMeister/ekgi2019-intro" target="_blank"> lecture</a>, 
			 Prof. Dr. Vera Meister presented the state of work and the development goals:</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li><b>fbwTube KG Editor:</b> For the video platform fbwTube, an easy-to-use editor is to be developed and integrated. 
			      The current complex and error-prone processes for editing the knowledge base are to be supported and automated to 
				  a large extent.</li>
			  <li><b>CoursePlan Interactive GUI:</b> Based on the knowledge schema of the Digital Module Catalog, an interactive app 
			      is to be developed that effectively supports collaborative curriculum planning for the facultx. The focus is on the 
				  real-time visualization of all relevant planning parameters.</li>
			  <li><b>AKWI Members Change Process:</b> A multi-step change process is to be developed for the implemented with jekyll RDF
			      AKWI member site, which in particular provides easily usable, integrated online forms for the contact persons on site.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>Still in October, a Design Thinking Workshop and a Mini-Hackaton with students from our partner university in Dnipro will 
		     take place to develop first spike solutions for the prototypes.

          <h2>BMaKE Seminar</h2>
          <p style="color:#969696">27th July 2019</p>
          <p>The last seminar in summer semester 2019 was entitled "Business model innovations based on blockchain technologies". 
		     There were three talks by students and graduates of ANUD:</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li>Marcel Cikus and Jan Beckert presented an IoT- and Blockchain-based approach from the energy sector. The aim is to motivate the 
			      customers of a local energy supplier to save energy costs and at the same time enable micro-investments in the field of "green energy".</li>
			  <li>Jonas Jetschni gave an overview of the global state of the art in blockchain technologies. As head of the BCG Platinion Chapter 
			      Blockchain for Central Europe and the Middle East, he is familiar with a variety of players and projects.</li>
			  <li>Philipp Bolte presented the results of his Bachelor project, which he developed in cooperation with BCG Platinion. With his prototype, 
			      he demonstrates how blockchain technology can strengthen the rights and options of smaller market players in the field of the Sharing Economy.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>The Ethereum Blockchain was used for the practical implementations. 
		     The series of seminars concluded with a joint lunch at the Trattoria del Corso in Brandenburg at Havel.

          <p>The motto of the 8th Didactics Forum at BUAS was "Motivating & Teaching Diverse Study Groups - Sharing Teaching Experience". 
		     The focus was again on the question of motivating teaching - both for students and teachers. Many good teaching examples 
			 from our university as well as from our international partner universities were presented, this year from Latvia, Spain and Austria. 
			 The talk by Vera Meister and Marcel Cikus on an experimental didactic approach with Problem-based Learning in the module 
			 "Business Information Systems for Business Administration Bachelor 1" was the subject of a very lively discussion.

          <p>The topic of the seminar was the analysis of selected doctoral theses in the field of research. Prof. Vera Meister examined structure, 
		     research questions and accompanying publications of Sebastian Tramp's doctoral thesis "Distributed Semantic Social Networks: 
			 Architecture, Protocols, Applications". Wenxin Hu was concerned with the same goal to Sebastian Hellmann's doctoral thesis 
			 "Integrating Natural Language Processing and Language Resources Using Linked Data". Both theses were submitted to the Institute of 
			 Computer Science at the University of Leipzig in 2014/15. A slightly different approach was taken by Aleksandra Revina, 
			 who compared two publications from 2015: "Five essays on Innovation Management through Venturing and Early Internationalization" 
			 by Sebastian Fischer of the TU Berlin and "Matching Events and Activities. Preprocessing Event Logs for Process Analysis" 
			 by Thomas Baier from the University of Potsdam. The first work follows the cumulative approach, the second is a monographic manuscript.

          <p>The colleagues of the two technical universities in Brandenburg combine multiple activities in university policy and university self-administration.
   		     Examples are the nomination of external members to appointment commissions or the exchange within the framework of the 
			 Hochschullehrerbund <a href="https://hlb.de/startseite/" target="_blank">(hlb)</a> and the Arbeitskreis Wirtschaftsinformatik an 
			 Hochschulen f&uuml;r angewandte Wissenschaften <a href="http://akwi.de/" target="_blank">(AKWI)</a>. 
			 These cooperations are also good occasions to find out about best practices at the other university. As part of her research on 
			 digital module catalogues, Prof. Vera Meister talked to the Vice President for Digitisation and Quality Management of the 
			 <a href="https://en.th-wildau.de/" target="_blank">Technical University of Applied Sciences Wildau</a>, Prof. Dr. Stefan Kubica, 
			 about their web-based 			 system for the maintenance and presentation of module catalogues developed by the 
			 <a href="https://icampus.th-wildau.de/" target="_blank">iCampus-Wildau team</a>.

		     Berlin Semantic Web Meetup</a>. The topic was the use of Semantic Web technologies in the library world. 
		     The following questions were addressed: How has the use of library catalogs and metadata in general developed in recent decades? 
			 What is linked open data, how does it relate to the Semantic Web, and what problems can it solve for libraries? 
			 What data has been made available by libraries on the Web, and to what extent? 
			 How can this data be used both by libraries themselves to improve their services and by others to develop new services? 
			 Speakers were Felix Ostrowski - a web researcher and developer - and Johann Rolschewski, staff member of the Berlin State Library. 
			 Prof. Vera Meister has been attending the Semantic Web Meetup events regularly since 2014 and has already made

			 There the idea arose to cooperate within the scope of final theses or research and development projects. In March 2018 Jan Beckert - 
			 student of THB - started his compulsory internship at eccenca in Leipzig. In April 2017, he accompanied Prof. Vera Meister on an exchange

			 <li>EKEN - Enterprise Knowledge Engineering: 2nd semester Master Business Information Systems</li>
			 <li>EKGI - Enterprise Knowledge Graph Implementation: 3rd semester Master usiness Information Systems</li>
